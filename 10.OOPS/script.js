//!NOTE :function constrcutor are not a feature of javascript instead simply they're pattern has been developed by other developers, now everyone simply use this

//1. New Empty object {} is created

//3. Newly crated object{} is linked to prototype
//4. the object that was created in the beginning is then automatically returned from the construction function (Function automatically return  that empty object from the beggining )

//HINTS: when we use this contructors function we can create as many  different object as we want

//Now each of them is its own new object that we crate programatically using function constructor
//HINTS:
//Remember javascript doesn't have classical object oriended programming, an object created from a class is called an Instance
//now we didn't technically a create class here, because javascript doesn't have classes in the sense of traditional OOP.
//! however we did crate an object using constructor function
//constructor used beginning of the javascript to kind of simulate classes
//we we can say  "Jasmine is Instance(object)"
//?what is instance?
//objects that have been created from a constructor function.

//HINTS: whenever we create array like this const arr = [2, 3, 4, 52, 4, 5, 9]; it is indeed created by the array constructor that's why all of these works behind seces like we can use methods(map,filter,find,at push,pop so on..)
console.log(arr.__proto__); //prototype of array we can see all the methods that we use regualary in array(fill,filter,find,map,forEach,at so on....)
//HINTS:Each array doesn't contain all these methods instead each array inherite methods from its prototype
console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype); //true
// console.log(arr.__proto__);and it's not a end of prototype
console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__); //this is end of prototype (prototype top)
//HINTS:
//the prototype inheritance is really a mechanism for reusing code. so all of these built-in method here have to exist in only once somewhere in javascript engine and then all the array in our code get access to the functions through the prototype chain and prototypal inheritance

//now we can add new method to Array.Prototype object
//create method for array object that return all unique elements in the array
Array.prototype.unique = function () {
  return [...new Set(this)];
};
// arr = [2, 3, 4, 52, 52, 4, 6, 7, 7, 3, 4, 5, 9];

console.log(arr.unique(arr)); //[2, 3, 4, 52, 6, 7, 5, 9]
//!HINTS:
//Extending the prototype of built-in object is generally not a good idea
//if we work on very small project then we can do this like add our new methods to array prototype object otherwise don't do like this

//Reson for don't add new methods
//1. The first reason is that the next version of javascript might add  a method with same name that we are adding(unique) but that next version same name method will work on different way then proberly break our code
//2. The second reason is we shouldn't do this because when we are work on a team of developers, then it might be bad idea because multiple developers implement the same method with the different name that's gonna create so many bugs
//!add new features(method) to array is really nice expriment and fun but never do this

const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
console.dir(x => x + 1); //as we learn earlier function itself also object therefore it has also prototype and in this case the prototype will contain the methods that we've used previously on functions. so that (bind,apply,call so on..   )

//!Once again this is reason why we can actually call methods on functions it's because they're objects and objects have prototypes and in this case this is function prototype

  //!HINTS:
  //Important to undestand here is that all of these methods that we write in the class, so outside of the constructor will be on the prototype of the objects. And not on the object themselves
  //!Method will be added to .prototype property

//1. Classes are not hoisted(In function we can use before that declare but it's not possible in class)
//2. Just like function classes are also first-class citizens.(that mean we can pass them into functions and also return them from functions)
//3. The body of the class is always executed in strict mode(Even if we didn't activate for entire script, all the code  that is in the class  will be executed in strict mode)

*/
//==============Setters and Getters in Javascript===========
//Every object in javascript can have setter and getter properties
//And we call these special properties accessor properties while the more normal properties are called data properties
//Getters and Setter are just a  function that set and get a value but on the outside they still look like a regular properties

/*
//Example
const accounts = {
  owner: 'saravanan',
  movements: [200, 300, 444, 500, 98, 101],

  get latest() {

  //any setter method need to have  exactly  one paramter
  set latest(mov) {
    this.movements.push(mov);
  },
};

//getter property
console.log(accounts.latest); //if it was a method then it would be like this latest() now this is property
//This can be very useful when we want to read something as a property but still need to do some calculation before

//setter property
//don't assing values like a regular method because it's not a method like account.latest(10);

//set values to setter property
accounts.latest = 500;
console.log(accounts.movements);

//!HINTS:
//getter and setter can actually very usefull for data validation
//example
class PersonCl {
  constructor(fullName, birthYear) {
    //properites
    this.fullName = fullName;
    this.birthYear = birthYear;
  }
  //instance methods
  //method will be added to .prototype.property

  //set a property that already exists

      //now _fullName is new variable
      this._fullName = name;
    } else {

//basically full name contain some spaces

  //now big problem is no browser support this syntax

// let a = 10;

// console.log(b);
// console.log(-20);-(value)

//create new account

// console.log(acc1._pin);
//====now try to access producted one====
// console.log(acc1.#pin);error
// console.log(acc1.#movements); it give error we can access private property

//call static method

//Chaining
//in chaining previously we can do like first map and filter and reduce we can do that all thin linear way this is chaining

// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private;
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. They experiment with chining!

DATA CAR 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

GOOD LUCK ð
