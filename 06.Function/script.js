//HINTS:
//These are just example but in real javascript doesn't have pass by reference it has only pass by values
//in other language like c++ it has both pass by values and pass by reference evern in primitive types

//function accepting and call back function in javascript
//That function accept input as an input

//this is the function that get string(multiple string with space) it will return it as single string without space
const oneWord = function (str) {
  //replace space as empty string  example java script =>javascript
  //   /space/g ... g-> mean globally if we give i-> i mean ignore case sensitivity

transformer(`Javascript is really fun to learn!`, oneWord); //arguments and call back function
//call back we didn't call the fucntion javascript call this function latter
//Best example Add event listener function

//JS CALL BACK ALL THE TIME
const high5 = function () {
  console.log('ðŸ‘‹');

//emoji will be diplayed when we click the body of the document
document.body.addEventListener('click', high5); //addEventListener function inside call back function
//No matter addEventListener is higher order function and high5 is call back funtion

//other example with array
['Saravanan', 'Jasmine', 'Santhosh', 'Allwin'].forEach(high5); //call back function

//Why we use call back function?
//Why call back function used many times in javascript?

//1st big advantage is
//that's make it easy to split up our code into more re-usual and interconnected parts

//2nd Important advantage is
//Call back function allows us to crate abstraction
//Abstraction is one of the core concept in oops
//abstraction mean we don't need to care about what inside the happening we just use the function otherwise we don't care about how it work, we don't care about the details
//we want to achieve something but we don't care about internal level of details that's all
//Even our trasnformer function also abstraction we just call the function we never worry about how it's transfored though we write code

//Own Excerice
const ageCalc = function (birthyear) {
  const currentYear = new Date();
  return currentYear.getFullYear() - birthyear;
};

const details = function (name, year, fn) {
  console.log(`your Name is ${name} and your age is ${fn(year)}`);

      18 - age
    } year to vote ðŸ¥º`;
  }
};

const person = function (name, age, fn) {
  console.log(`Hello! ${name}, ${fn(age)}`);
};

//call the person function
//In this example we just pass the arguments and function
//we know the name and age but we don't worry about how it's computing inside the function in vote
person('jasime', 21, vote);
person('Allwin', 17, vote);

// Function Returns Function
//function return another function
//this is called functional paradigm
const greet = function (greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
  };
};
//greet is return function, it return function so we store it another variable so that variable also function
const greeterHey = greet('Hey');
//now greeterHey also function so we just call the function that inside
//how inside the function work how can it work because it's called clouser
//it hard to understand becuase it's difucult
//clouser's most misunderstood topic in javascript
greeterHey('Saravanan');
greeterHey('Jasmine');

//another way of calling inside the function
greet('Hi')('Saravanan'); //look wired

//writing function return function in (arrow function)
//arrow function is liner way function we don't need to write function and return type

  //writing method without having function

//now this book function is totaly different
//it doesn't work
// book(12, 'Allwin'); //it will give error because it's not relation with air Aisa object and outside book is just take copy of air Asia object method not passing values to air Asia Object

//how to call the method inside the object
//they're three function available call,bind and apply

//Instead of
//now this book is really object and object have method and then function have methods too and call method is one of them
book.call(airWings, 23, 'Saravanan'); //first arguments is exactly what we want to this keyword point to,

//example for apply

//HINTS : in modern way we never often use apply method, we always prefer better way of exact same thing as arguments

//instead of using apply we simply use call method we don't need to create separate array for passing argumetns

//we can use spread operators also

//The Bind Method
//just like call method bind method also set this keyword manually for any function call
//The different the bind method doesn't immidiately call the function, instead it will return new function where this new keyword bound

//book.call(airWings, 25, 'Sajitha');

const bookAW = book.bind(airWings); //it will return new function where this keyword always be set to airWings

//assume they have 3000 planes

/* 
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
